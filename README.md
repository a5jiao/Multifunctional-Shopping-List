# Multifunctional-Shopping-List
Instructions for Set-up:

Download the folder 'Shopping List' and open in any Java IDE.

The code is formatted so that data is read from and written to 'Data/Lists' and 'Data/Items/items.txt', so if the directories are changed in any way the program will not function. 

This can be fixed by editing any of string sections in Main.java.

Run the file 'Main.java' and enjoy the experience of a flawlessly friendly Shopping List!

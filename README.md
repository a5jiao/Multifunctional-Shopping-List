# multishop
A multifunctional shopping list app written purely in Java, built on the foundations of object-oriented programming.

Instructions for Set-up:

Download as zip, up-zip and upload the resulting folder into any Java IDE. Make sure to drag all the contents out of the unzipped folder, as well as 'Shopping List'. There should be NO folder that everything collectively sits in.

The code is formatted so that data is read from and written to 'Data/Lists' and 'Data/Items/items.txt', so if the directories are changed in any way the program will not function. 

This can be fixed by editing any of string sections in Main.java.

Run the file 'Main.java' and enjoy the experience of a flawlessly friendly Shopping List!
